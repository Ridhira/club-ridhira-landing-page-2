ðŸ‘‰ Q1. What is React?
Ans: React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or Ul components, developed by Facebook.

ðŸ‘‰ Q2. What is JSX
Ans: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React for describing what the UI should look like.

ðŸ‘‰ Q3. What is the virtual DOM?
Ans: The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM in memory. React uses it to improve performance by updating only the changed parts of the actual DOM.

ðŸ‘‰ Q4. What are state and props in React?
Ans: State is an internal data store that belongs to a specific component, and it can be changed over time. Props are properties passed to a component from its parent, and they are immutable.

ðŸ‘‰ Q5. What is the difference between state and props?
Ans: State is internal to a component and can be changed over time, while props are external and passed to a component and they are immutable..

ðŸ‘‰ Q6. What is the purpose of virtual DOM in React.js?
Ans: The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the DOM. Instead, React creates two copies of the virtual DOM (a new one and an old one). React compares the new virtual DOM with the old copy of the virtual DOM, then reflects only the changes to the actual DOM, updating only the parts that have changed.

ðŸ‘‰ Q7. How does React handle data flow?
Ans: React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows in one directionâ€”from parent to child components. This helps maintain a clear and predictable data flow, making the application easier to understand and debug.

ðŸ‘‰ Q8. What are React Hooks?
Ans: React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to use state and other React features without writing a class. They allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components, which simplifies code and promotes reusability. We can not use hooks in class components.

ðŸ‘‰ Q9. What is the significance of keys in React lists?
Ans: Keys are special attributes used by React to identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed in a list. They help React efficiently update the UI by minimizing re-renders of list items.

ðŸ‘‰ Q10. What are the advantages of using React.js?
Ans: React.js offers several advantages, including improved performance with virtual DOM, reusability and modularity with component-based architecture, enhanced developer experience with JSX syntax, and strong community support and ecosystem.

ðŸ‘‰ Q11. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
Ans: Controlled components are those whose form elements (like input, textarea, select) are controlled by React state, while uncontrolled components are directly controlled by the DOM.

ðŸ‘‰ Q12. What is the purpose of setState in React?
Ans: setState is used to update the state of a component and trigger a re-render. We use the setState method in class components, while in functional components, we use a hook called useState that gives us a setter function to update the state.

ðŸ‘‰Q13. What is React Router?
Ans: React Router is a library that enables navigation among views in a React application, allowing for the development of single-page applications, It allows you to define routes, nested routes, and dynamic routes in your application. and also ensures that the page does not reload after we navigate to another. 

ðŸ‘‰Q14. Explain the useEffect hook.
Ans: The useEffect hook in React is used for side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount().

ðŸ‘‰Q15. What is Redux, and why is it used?
Ans: Redux is a global state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It helps manage the state of an application in a predictable, more organized and centralized way.

ðŸ‘‰ Q16. Explain the concept of lifting state up in React.
Ans: Lifting state up means moving the state of a component to its parent component so that multiple child components can share and update that state. This helps in managing state more efficiently across components.

ðŸ‘‰ Q17. Explain the concept of higher-order components (HOCs) in React.
Ans: Higher-order components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionalities. They're used to share common functionalities between components without repeating code.

ðŸ‘‰ Q18. What is the purpose of the memo function in React?
Ans: The memo function is used to optimize functional components by memoizing them. It helps prevent unnecessary re-renders by caching the result of the component's render function.

ðŸ‘‰ Q19. What is the purpose of the context API in React?
Ans: Context API is used for managing global state in React applications. It allows passing data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

ðŸ‘‰ Q20. Explain the concept of hooks in React and provide examples of some commonly used hooks.
Ans: Hooks are functions that allow you to use React features like state and lifecycle methods in functional components. Some commonly used hooks include:
useState: Allows functional components to have state.
useEffect: Performs side effects in functional components, like fetching data or subscribing to events.
useContext: Allows functional components to consume context.

ðŸ‘‰ Q21. What is the significance of the Fragment element in React?
ðŸ“—Ans: The Fragment element in React JS is like a special container that helps group multiple elements together without adding extra nodes to the HTML structure. It's useful when you want to return multiple elements from a component without needing to wrap them in a div or other container, which could affect your layout or styling.

ðŸ‘‰ Q22. What is the role of the useReducer hook in state management?
ðŸ“—Ans: The useReducer hook in React is used for managing more complex state logic in your components. It's like a more powerful version of useState. Instead of directly updating the state based on its current value, you can specify how the state should change based on an action. This is particularly helpful when you have state that depends on previous state or when you have multiple values that need to be updated together.

ðŸ‘‰ Q23. Describe the purpose of the refs in React and How can we create refs?
ðŸ“—Ans: Refs in React provide a way to access and interact with DOM elements or React components directly. They're useful for tasks like focusing on input fields, triggering animations. we can create refs using useRef hook.

ðŸ‘‰ Q24. How does React handle events? differences between synthetic events and native events.
ðŸ“—Ans: React handles events in a cross-browser compatible way using synthetic events. These synthetic events wrap around native browser events, providing consistent behavior across different browsers. The main difference between synthetic events and native events is that synthetic events are normalized by React to ensure consistency across browsers and provide additional features, while native events are the events directly provided by the browser.

ðŸ‘‰ Q25. What is the purpose of the dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute in React?
ðŸ“—Ans: The dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute in React js is used to set HTML directly from React components. It's typically used when you need to render HTML content received from an external source, like a server or an API. However, it's called "dangerous" because it can expose your application to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if not used carefully, since it bypasses React's built-in XSS protections. So, it should only be used when you trust the source of the HTML content.

ðŸ‘‰ Q26. What is the purpose of the React.StrictMode component?
ðŸ“—Ans: React.StrictMode is like a helper tool in React that helps you catch common mistakes and bugs early during development. It's not for production use but helps you write better React js code by highlighting potential problems.

ðŸ‘‰ Q27. How does React handle forms and form validation?
ðŸ“—Ans: React helps you manage forms by storing form data in its state. It's recommended to use controlled components to handle forms. For validation, you can use built-in form features like required attribute, or you can create custom validation functions that check input values against certain criteria, like whether they're empty or meet a specific format. 

ðŸ‘‰ Q28. what is core components and custom components in react
ðŸ“—Ans: Core components in React are built-in components provided by React itself, like div, span, input, etc. Custom components are ones you create yourself for specific parts of your app. You can reuse them throughout your project to keep your code organized and maintainable.

ðŸ‘‰ Q29. What is the role of shouldComponentUpdate and PureComponent in React optimization?
ðŸ“—Ans: shouldComponentUpdate is a method you can define in your React components to control when the component should re-render. PureComponent is a special type of component that automatically performs a shallow comparison of props and state, and if they haven't changed, it prevents unnecessary re-renders. These are used to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary rendering cycles.

ðŸ‘‰ Q30. How does React handle error boundaries?
ðŸ“—Ans: Error boundaries in React are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app. This helps in making apps more robust by preventing unhandled errors from breaking the entire user interface.

ðŸ‘‰ Q31. Explain the significance of the useEffect dependencies array and What can go wrong if we forget something in that list?
ðŸ“—Ans: The useEffect dependencies array tells React when to run the effect. If you put variables in this array, the effect will run whenever any of those variables change. Forgetting to include variables in this array can lead to bugs where the effect doesn't update when it should or updates unnecessarily.

ðŸ‘‰ Q32. Explain the concept of suspense in React and its use cases.
ðŸ“—Ans: Suspense in React helps manage asynchronous operations, like fetching data or lazy-loading components. It allows you to show fallback content while waiting for the main content to load. It's useful for improving user experience by avoiding loading spinners and keeping users engaged.

ðŸ‘‰ Q33. Explain the concept of code splitting in React and its advantages.
ðŸ“—Ans: . Code splitting means breaking your code into smaller chunks and loading them only when needed. In React, it's often used with dynamic imports to load parts of your app asynchronously. This speeds up initial load times and reduces the amount of code users need to download, improving performance.

ðŸ‘‰ Q34. Describe the significance of the forwardRef function in React.
ðŸ“—Ans: forwardRef allows you to pass a ref from a parent component to a child component. It's useful when you need to access a child component's DOM node or React element directly from the parent. This can be important for integrating with third-party libraries or managing focus and scrolling behavior.

ðŸ‘‰ Q35. Explain the purpose of the displayName property in React components.
ðŸ“—Ans: The displayName property is used for debugging and improving code readability. It gives a name to a component, making it easier to identify in React DevTools or error messages.

ðŸ‘‰ Q36. How does React handle security concerns, such as preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks?
ðŸ“—Ans: React prevents security issues like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by using a feature called JSX, which automatically escapes any potentially harmful content. It also provides features like prop validation and the use of libraries like DOMPurify to further secure applications.

ðŸ‘‰ Q38. Explain the concept of React portals and when you might use them.
ðŸ“—Ans: React portals are a way to render child components outside of their parent component's DOM hierarchy. They're useful when you need to render a component at a different place in the DOM hierarchy or when dealing with modal dialogs, tooltips, or popovers.

ðŸ‘‰ Q37. Discuss the differences between shallow rendering and full rendering in testing React components.
ðŸ“—Ans: Shallow rendering in testing React components only renders the component itself, without rendering its children. Full rendering, on the other hand, renders the component along with all of its children components. Shallow rendering is faster but may not catch issues deep within the component tree, while full rendering ensures a more comprehensive test but can be slower.

ðŸ‘‰ Q39. why is State immutable in redux.
ðŸ“—Ans: In Redux, state is immutable to ensure that changes are predictable and traceable. It helps in managing application state more effectively by enforcing a single source of truth and making state changes easier to understand and debug.

ðŸ‘‰ Q40. why Reducer is pure function in redux.
ðŸ“—Ans: Reducers in Redux are pure functions because they should not have side effects and should always return the same output for a given input. This predictability makes it easier to test and reason about the behavior of reducers. They take the previous state and an action, and return a new state without modifying the previous state directly.

ðŸ‘‰ Q41. What are stateful and stateless components?
ðŸ“—Ans: Stateful components are ones that can hold and manage their own data, known as state. They have the ability to change and update data over time. Stateless components, on the other hand, don't manage their own data; they receive data from their parent components via props and render UI based on that data. They are purely presentational and don't have their own internal state. Class component also called stateful and Functional component called stateless because you have to use hooks in order to make it stateful.

ðŸ‘‰ Q42. How do you update state in React?
ðŸ“—Ans: In React, state can be updated using the setState() method provided by the React library. This method takes an object as an argument, where keys represent the state properties to update and their corresponding values represent the new values of those properties. When setState() is called, React re-renders the component with the updated state, reflecting the changes in the user interface. also in functional component we can use setter function of useState hook. 

ðŸ‘‰ Q43. What is Reconciliation in react?
ðŸ“—Ans:  Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the UI to match the most recent changes in the component's state or props. When state or props change, React compares the new tree of React elements with the previous one and determines the minimal set of changes needed to update from virtual DOM to the actual DOM. This process ensures that the UI remains in sync with the application's state efficiently, optimizing performance by only re-rendering what is necessary.

ðŸ‘‰ Q44. What are the diffing algorithms in react ?
ðŸ“—Ans:  React uses diffing algorithms to efficiently update the user interface when something changes. There are mainly two types :
Tree Diffing: Compares old and new trees to update specific parts of the web page, avoiding full-page re-renders.
Component Diffing: Assigns unique IDs to components and updates only those affected by state or props changes, optimizing performance.

ðŸ‘‰ Q45. What is Recoil ?
ðŸ“—Ans: Recoil is a library made by Facebook for managing the state of a React application. It simplifies the process of sharing and updating data across different parts of the app. In Recoil, you create units of state called "atoms" that hold pieces of data. Components can read from and write to these atoms to access and modify the application's state. Recoil provides an easy way to manage complex state logic and helps in keeping the code organized and efficient.

ðŸ‘‰ Q46. Explain the purpose of lifecycle methods in React.
ðŸ“—Ans: Lifecycle methods in React help you control what happens at different stages of a component's life, like when it's created, updated, or removed from the DOM. They allow you to perform actions like fetching data, updating the UI, or cleaning up resources.

ðŸ‘‰ Q47. How does React handle data binding?
ðŸ“—Ans: React uses a concept called "props" (short for properties) to pass data from one component to another. When a component's props change, React automatically re-renders the component with the new data.

ðŸ‘‰ Q48. Explain the purpose of useMemo() and useCallback() hooks.
ðŸ“—Ans: useMemo() is a hook used for memoization, which means it helps in optimizing performance by caching the result of expensive calculations. useCallback() is similar but specifically for memoizing functions, preventing unnecessary re-creation of functions on every render.

ðŸ‘‰ Q49. What are the differences between useMemo() and useCallback()?
ðŸ“—Ans: The main difference is in what they memoize. useMemo() memoizes the result of a function call, while useCallback() memoizes the function itself. So, useMemo() is for optimizing expensive calculations, and useCallback() is for optimizing function creation.

ðŸ‘‰ Q50. What are the different ways to handle events in React?
ðŸ“—Ans: There are a few ways to handle events in React:
Inline event handlers: Directly specify event handlers in JSX.
Using addEventListener(): Similar to traditional DOM manipulation, but less common in React.
Using SyntheticEvent: React provides a synthetic event system that normalizes events across different browsers.
Using event delegation: Handling events at a higher level in the component tree and letting them propagate down to child components.

It also provides features like nested routes and URL parameters for more advanced routing needs.

ðŸ‘‰ Q96. How does React support server-side rendering (SSR) with Node.js?
âœ… Ans: React can be used on the server side with Node.js to render web pages. It means React can create the initial HTML for a webpage on the server before sending it to the browser. This helps in faster page loading and better search engine optimization (SEO).

ðŸ‘‰ Q97. Describe the concept of "composition vs. inheritance" in React component design.
âœ… Ans: Composition means building components by combining smaller components together, like putting LEGO blocks together to create something bigger. Inheritance, on the other hand, involves creating new components by extending the features of existing ones, which is like inheriting traits from your parents. In React, it's generally better to use composition over inheritance because it's more flexible and leads to less complex code.

ðŸ‘‰ Q98. How does React support code reuse and maintainability in large-scale applications?
âœ… Ans: React encourages code reuse through component-based architecture, where UIs are built as a combination of reusable components. This makes it easier to maintain and update code because changes made to one component won't affect others.

ðŸ‘‰ Q99. How does React handle memory management and garbage collection?
âœ… Ans: React automatically manages memory by keeping track of components and their state. When a component is no longer needed, React will remove it from memory through a process called garbage collection. This helps in efficient memory usage and prevents memory leaks.

ðŸ‘‰ Q100. What are the differences between React's componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate lifecycle methods?
âœ… Ans: componentDidMount is called after a component is rendered for the first time, while componentDidUpdate is called after a component is updated (i.e., when props or state change). So, componentDidMount is used for tasks that should happen once after the initial render, like fetching data from a server, while componentDidUpdate is used for tasks that should happen after each update, like updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.

ðŸ‘‰ Q101. What is the difference between class components and functional components? 
Ans: class components use ES6 classes and have additional features like state and lifecycle methods, while functional components are simpler and are often used with hooks. class components also know as stateful components and functional components know as stateless components
